USAGE

Format: cated [ FILE ]

cated is a light-weight text editor. To use it, invoke it with

cated FILE

and then enter lines as you usually would enter them into cat. You can edit the
line before you press the Enter key to go to the next line.

If FILE is not specified, the result will be written out to stdout.

To write out the file, press Ctrl-D. You may have to press Ctrl-D twice if the
line you are currently editing is not blank.

To abort editing press Ctrl-C. If FILE was specified, it will not be
overwritten. If FILE was not specified and the output of cated was being piped
into another command, the pipeline will be aborted.


VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

The cated is thought to be used with version control systems. Below, you may
find a few configuration and usage examples.


USAGE WITH BAZAAR

In order to specify cated as the editor used for commit messages in bazaar, set
the following option in ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf, in the [DEFAULT] section:

editor = /path/to/cated

There are other ways to do this, refer to the bazaar manual.

In order to use cated with bazaar:

1. run bzr ci myfile, log in if needed.
2. cated will show you the temporary file names:

(cat > /tmp/cated.ext > /tmp/file.ext).

3. type in your commit message. You can use the backspace, and you can enter
   new lines, but lines already entered cannot be changed. Then press Ctrl-D
   once to save the message. You may have to press Ctrl-D twice if the line you
   are currently editing is not blank. To abort editing, press Ctrl-C. This
   will abort the commit, because bzr notices that the temporary file has not
   been modified.


USAGE WITH MERCURIAL

In order to specify cated as the editor used for commit messages in mercurial,
go to your repository and set the following option in .hg/hgrc, in the [ui]
section:

editor = /path/to/cated

There are other ways to do this, refer to the mercurial manual.

Usage is similar to bazaar, please read the section above.


USAGE WITH OTHER VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

You can probably use cated with any VCS out there - though I haven't tried. Try
reading the sections above for mercurial and bazaar, and compare with the
manual for the VCS you are using.
